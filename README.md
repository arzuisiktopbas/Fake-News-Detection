# Fake News Detection
### Problem Statement
Fake News is pervasive nowadays and is too simple to broadcast via social media and challenging for us to recognize. It is almost impossible to prevent the spread of fake news. It is vital to recognize and differentiate between false and accurate news.

In this project, my goal is to build a model that can distinguish fake news with as much accuracy as possible by utilizing deep learning tools.

Although there are many other unstructured formats of news content available online (including documents, videos, and audio), I focus on news in text format.
